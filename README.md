🧠 NLP Concepts with Machine Learning

This repository documents my learning journey through Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Machine Learning techniques.
It contains practical examples, experiments, and notes covering various NLP preprocessing and modeling techniques such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and text classification using algorithms like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

📘 Overview

The goal of this repository is to explore how machines understand and classify human language.
Through multiple hands-on implementations, I learned how to:

Preprocess raw text data

Convert text into numerical features

Train and evaluate machine learning models for text classification
